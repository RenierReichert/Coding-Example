This folder contains the Unity project I created for my master thesis.
For copyright reasons, the videos that belong in the streamingassets folder are available upon request.

In this project, the EAC- and ERP-shaders were made by community members of the Unity-forums.
The project is made compatible for multiple VR-HMD devices by using OpenVR, created by Unity.

Most of my work is found in the Renier_pip_prefabless.unity scene, and in the Scripts folder.
